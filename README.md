# My Personal website

This is the development repository of [my personal website](https://pappbalazs.com).

## Development status

This is the place where I will track the status of the development. I just simply don't wanna use any third-party applications for only this.

-   [ ] Creating the API
    -   [ ] Create the basic framework
    -   [ ] Sending messages via email
    -   [ ] Set up the database and its tables
    -   [ ] Managing admin users
    -   [ ] Fetch images from [my instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/_pappbalazs/)
    -   [ ] Filtering which posts to show from my instagram page
-   [ ] Create the admin page to easily manage the content of the site
-   [ ] Develop the client side of the page itself
    -   [ ] TODO: Expand the task list for it

## Frameworks, databases, etc. that I will use

Here I will list what technologies I use for each component of the site.

| Component | Technology                                                                  |
| :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend   | PHP, custom made, I promise it will be very eclectic.                       |
| Database  | MySQL                                                                       |
| Frontend  | Haven't decided yet. Maybe Vue, I used that the last time (who knows when). |
